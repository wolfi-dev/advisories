          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to 'guava', one of spark's dependencies.
            Remediating this requires upgrading guava to v24.1.1 or higher, which is a significant version upgrade.
            Spark has already upgraded to a fixed version in the main branch, but this is yet to be backported to the spark v3.5 release.
            Attempting to upgrade guava results in build issues. For more information, see:

            This has been fixed in netty > v4.1.100, and spark has upgraded to a later version in main.
            However, attempts to backport to this release of spark, result in build failures.

            Attempting to upgrade this dependency in spark v3 results in build failures, specifically compatibility issues with the 'maven-shade-plugin'.

          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to 'netty-common', used by spark. A fixed version is available in v4.1.115.
            Spark has upgraded to a later version in main, but attempts to backport to this release of spark, result in build failures.
            Awaiting for fix / backport from upstream to address this issue.
