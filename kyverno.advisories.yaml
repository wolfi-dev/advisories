        data:
          note: Confirmed that the affected code is present in the binary, but Kyverno needs to migrate its code off of the Go packages keeping it at the affected version of go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp. It looks like the release-1.11 branch has made these adjustments and dependency updates, and once the final 1.11 release is out, this Wolfi package will get updated.
