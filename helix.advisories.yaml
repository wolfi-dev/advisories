          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to the 'idna' dependency, and is fixed in v1.0.0 and later.
            Attempts to upgrade 'idna' have failed, as there are multiple dependencies requiring different versions of `idna`.
            One such example is 'url'. Attempts to upgrade 'url' to a version compatible with idna v1.0.0 result in additional build failures.
            Pending fix from upstream.
