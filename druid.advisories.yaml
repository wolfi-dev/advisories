          note: |
            This vulnerability is related to 'derby', one of the dependencies of Apache druid.
            A fix is available, but requires upgrading 'derby' to 'v10.17.1.0'. Attempting to upgrade druid to this version results in build failures.
            derby v10.17.1.0 requires Java 21. Apache druid does not support currently support Java 21.
