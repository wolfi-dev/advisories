            Upstream maintainers must cut a Hadoop release with Avro 1.11.4+ to resolve this CVE. The vulnerability is in jackson-core 2.12.7 bundled within hadoop-client-runtime-3.4.1.jar. Spark PR #40933 (SPARK-43263) attempted to upgrade Jackson to 2.15.0 but encountered dependency conflicts with Avro 1.11.1 which still pulls Jackson 2.12.7. The PR discussion confirmed that Avro must be upgraded first, which requires a new Hadoop release. CVE-2025-49128 is fixed in Jackson 2.13.0+.

            Upstream maintainers must cut a Hadoop release with Avro 1.11.4 to resolve these CVEs. PR #7615 (HADOOP-19315) has been merged on 2025-04-15 which upgrades Avro from 1.9.2 to 1.11.4. This addresses both CVE-2024-47561 (critical severity) and CVE-2023-39410 (high severity) in the avro 1.9.2 dependency bundled within hadoop-client-runtime-3.4.1.jar. The PR notes this change is not backwards compatible due to Avro's requirement for setter/getter methods and serializable package declarations.

            Upstream maintainers must complete the migration from Jetty 11 to Jetty 12 to resolve this CVE. PR #45500 (SPARK-47086) was opened on 2024-03-13 but was closed without merging. The migration is complex as it requires updating all Jetty multiple dependency and API changes. Spark currently uses jetty-http 11.0.24 in spark-core_2.13-4.0.0.jar. CVE-2024-6763 is fixed in Jetty 12.0.12.

            Upstream maintainers must cut a Hadoop release with the following changes to resolve this CVE. The fix has already been merged in PR #7524 (HADOOP-18991) which removes the unused commons-beanutils dependency entirely from Hadoop 3. The PR was merged on 2025-03-20. Spark depends on hadoop-client-runtime-3.4.1.jar which bundles this vulnerable dependency.

            Upstream maintainers must upgrade Hive from 2.3.10 to 4.0.1+ to resolve this CVE. JIRA ticket SPARK-52408 tracks this upgrade request. The vulnerability CVE-2024-29869 affects hive-exec 2.3.10 which is bundled in hive-exec-2.3.10-core.jar. This is a significant upgrade as Hive 4.x has major API changes compared to 2.x series.
