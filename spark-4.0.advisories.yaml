          note: Due to complexity of implementation required to upgrade the version of Zookeeper to a fix version, the upstream maintainers are planning on releasing it as a part of a major release. So we require upstream maintainers to implement this fix. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47402
