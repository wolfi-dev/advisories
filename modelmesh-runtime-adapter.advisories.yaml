          note: |
            Remediating this vulnerability requires upgrading the 'azidentity' dependency to version v1.6.0 or later.
            Upgrading this dependency, results in compatibility issues with another dependency, 'azblob'.
            Attempting to upgrade both azidentity and azblob was also not successful.
            Waiting on fix from upstream.
