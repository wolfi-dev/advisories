        type: false-positive-determination
        data:
          type: vulnerability-record-analysis-contested
          note: Upon further investigation, we have determined that this is not a security issue in the Python package itself. It's still possible to misuse the Python standard library, such as by supplying untrusted data to the tar extraction functions, in which case a vulnerability should be identified in the caller code.
