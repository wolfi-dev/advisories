          note: The commons-io dependency is a transitive dependency that Is brought in under swagger-core which is currently kept under 2.14.0 due to the fact that this version and up drop support for jdk8. The repository is currently working on transitioning on making jdk11 the minimum version but is in the middle of that process and is not currently ready. Here is the PR regarding this https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17441 and the project status can be found here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12894

          note: Updating jetty to a non-vulnerable version would require 3 major version bumps, which would be a very significant upgrade with multiple breaking changes, and should only be undertaken by the upstream maintainers.

        data:
          note: Remediating this CVE requires dropping support for JDK11Â which is why the changes are not being back ported from the main branch into version branches 3.8 and 3.9. This will be fixed in the kafka-4.0.0 release which is targeted in to land in late January 2025.
