            This vulnerability was discovered and fixed in Keycloak in 2017, specifically
            in commit 463661b051efa28e85e9da16a206bad6b1b1bb63 and released in version 3.4.0.
            Our Keycloak packaging began more than 6 years after this vulnerability was patched.
            The vulnerable code has been entirely rewritten in newer versions.
            This is a false positive triggered by security scanners matching on the package name without
            considering the version timeline.
