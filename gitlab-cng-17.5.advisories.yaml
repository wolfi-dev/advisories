          note: 'GitLab advises that maintainers should NOT upgrade dependency versions manually, as their automation would have already applied this in cases of simple version increments. If a dependency version has not yet been upgraded, there is usually a good reason. Additionally, past attempts to upgrade GitLab dependencies ahead of the upstream release have resulted in build issues. '
