          note: |
            This vulnerability affects github.com/docker/docker (also known as github.com/moby/moby) versions up to v25.0.4.
            The version currently in use is v25.0.6, which already includes the patch: https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/8e3bcf19748838b30e34d612832d1dc9d90363b8
            However, the CVE detection appears to be incorrectly triggered due to a version parsing mismatch — likely because the module version includes a +incompatible suffix.
