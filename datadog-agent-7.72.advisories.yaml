          note: 'The outdated version of urllib3 (1.26.20) is included because it''s a dependency of py3-pip. Updating it will require the main pip project to release an update. However, the pip maintainers are holding off on that update until Python 3.9 reaches its end-of-life (EOL) at the end of 2025. Once that happens, pip can upgrade, and then kubeflow-katib will also need to update to align with the changes in pip.

        data:
          type: vulnerable-code-not-included-in-package
          note: While pip's vendor.txt correctly shows setuptools==70.3.0 (which contains the vulnerability in its full form), pip's vendoring process explicitly drops all components containing the vulnerable code. The PackageIndex.download() vulnerability exists in the setuptools package and easy_install.py, both of which are removed during pip's vendoring process. Only pkg_resources is kept, which does not contain download functionality or the vulnerable code path.
