          note: Prometheus ships a Go (Golang) library with a versioning scheme that follows the 0.x format. However, the Prometheus application itself uses a versioning scheme based on 1.x, 2.x, etc. The vulnerability identified in CVE-2019-3826 is specifically associated with the Prometheus application, not the Golang library.
