          note: |
            This vulnerability is related to the 'rsa' dependency, of which atuin is already installing the most recent version (0.9.6).
            There is no release of 'rsa' today with a fix for this vulnerability. The RSA GitHub project is working on pre-releases, so a fix may be expected soon.
            Waiting for upstream (RSA) to cut a new release with a fix, and for atuin to consume.

          note: |
            Remediating this vulnerability requires upgrading: sqlx to version 0.8.1 or higher.
            However, attempting to upgrade this results in build errors, as other dependencies expect different versions of sqlx.
            The main branch has upgraded to sqlx v0.8.1, however this has not made it into a release yet.
            Pending fix from upstream in the next release.
