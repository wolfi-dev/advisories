          note: 'This vulnerability relates to the GitLab dependency: [gem] sinatra @ 2.2.4, GitLab advises that maintainers should NOT upgrade dependency versions manually, as their automation would have already applied this in cases of simple version increments. If a dependency version has not yet been upgraded, there is usually a good reason. Additionally, past attempts to upgrade GitLab dependencies ahead of the upstream release have resulted in build issues.  deferring to upstream (GitLab) to address this CVE in a subsequent update.
