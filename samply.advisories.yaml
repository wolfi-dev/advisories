          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to the 'idna' dependency, and is fixed in v1.0.0 and later.
            Attempts to upgrade 'idna' have failed, as there are multiple dependencies requiring different versions of `idna`.
            For example, 'url' requires idna v0.5.0 - upgrading 'url' to a newer version, results in compatibility issues with 'reqwest'.
            Pending fix from upstream.
