          note: |
            This vulnerability was discovered and fixed in Keycloak in 2017, specifically
            in commit 463661b051efa28e85e9da16a206bad6b1b1bb63 and released in version 3.4.0.
            Our Keycloak packaging began more than 6 years after this vulnerability was patched.
            The vulnerable code has been entirely rewritten in newer versions.
            This is a false positive triggered by security scanners matching on the package name without
            considering the version timeline.

        data:
          note: |
            Keycloak currently depends on quarkus v3.20.2.1, which in turn depends on the affected version of commons-lang3.
            Quarkus have fixed the vulnerability in v3.35.4, but have yet to backport it to the v3.20 stream.
            Attempts to force the upgrade of commons-lang3 to the fixed version result in build failures.
            Attempts to upgrade Keycloak to the v3.35 version stream of Quarkus (with the fix), also result in build failures.
            Pending upstream fix, specifically for Quarkus to create a v3.20 patch release, or for Keycloak to do the refactor needed for upgrading to Quarkus v3.35.
