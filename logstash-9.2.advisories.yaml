          note: The rexml dependency has been upgraded at v3.4.2. The rexml gem at v3.3.9 remained is included as a default gem in JRuby’s standard library. Because it’s part of JRuby itself rather than a separately managed gem, an updated JRuby release is required to incorporate the remediated version of rexml.
