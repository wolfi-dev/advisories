          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to the openfga dependency, and is fixed in v1.8.3 and later.
            Upstream is still using an older version and has not upgraded yet.
            Attempts to upgrade to v1.8.3 introduce build issues, specifically around the zanzana component, likely introduced by a datastore change in v1.6.1 of openfga.
            The main branch may include refactors to accommodate this, but these haven't been released.
            Main is still several versions behind the CVE fixed version.
