          note: This relates to jackson-mapper-asl, which is no longer maintained. Apache Spark has taken actions to remove their own dependency on the library, however a transitive dependency (ranger), still requires it. Waiting for upstream https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11659.

          note: 'This issue concerns codehaus jackson-mapper-asl, which is no longer maintained. Spark has a transitive dependency on this library due to Hive 2.3, which requires it to initialize the FunctionRegistry. Hive 3.x, planned for Spark 4.x, should remove the dependency on codehaus-jackson. However, even if the vulnerability is fixed in Spark 4.x, it won''t be possible to backport the fix to Spark 3.5.x due to its dependency on Hive 2.3.

          note: |
            This relates to 'derby',Spark-3.5 currently uses version 10.14.2.0, while the closest fixed version available in the Maven Central repository is 10.17.1.0. However, this version requires a minimum of Java 17 to build, whereas Spark-3.5 is built with Java 8 and 11 as well. Upgrading to 10.17.1.0 would cause a build break due to Java bytecode version incompatibility. At this time, we are not planning to upgrade the version of Derby in Spark-3.5. The upstream project has updated to version 10.16.1.1, which does not resolve the vulnerability. The upstream is currently waiting for a backport to Derby version 10.16.2.x which they have planed to fix in version spark-4 or later. For reference, see: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44174
