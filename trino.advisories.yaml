        type: pending-upstream-fix
        data:
          note: 'The upstream project relies on a number of "shaded JARs", making it harder to update dependencies. The upstream project will need to migrate away from a number of shaded JARs, including: "gcs-connector-hadoop3-2.2.17-shaded.jar" and "rubix-presto-shaded-0.3.18.jar" for this vulnerability to be resolved.'

        type: pending-upstream-fix
        data:
          note: The upstream project relies on a number of "shaded JARs", making it harder to update dependencies. The upstream project will need to migrate away from "rubix-presto-shaded-0.3.18.jar" for this vulnerability to be resolved. This will likely involve a migration to a different package, since com.qubole.rubix.rubix-presto-shaded was last updated on 2020-11-24.
