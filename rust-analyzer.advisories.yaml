        data:
          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to the 'idna' dependency, and is fixed in v1.0.0 and later.
            Attempts to upgrade 'idna' have failed, as there are other dependencies requiring different versions of `idna`.
            For example, the 'url' requires idna v0.5.0. Upgrading 'url' to a newer version, results in further compatibility issues with the 'ide' package.
            Pending fix from upstream.
