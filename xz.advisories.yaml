          note: 'Chainguard''s analysis indicates that our build configuration of liblzma doesn''t include the malicious code due to not being Debian/RPM based. Out of an abundance of caution, versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 have been withdrawn from the distro. We are closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates as necessary: https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/chainguards-response-to-cve-2024-3094-aka-the-backdoor-in-xz-library'
