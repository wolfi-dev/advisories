          note: |
            This vulnerability relates to the 'lexical-core' dependency, and is fixed in v1.0.0.
            Unfortunately, nushell has other dependencies which depend on an older version of lexical-core.
            Upgrading lexical-core causes build failures. Waiting for upstream to fix.
