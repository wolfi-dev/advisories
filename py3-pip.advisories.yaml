          note: CVE-2024-47081 is patched via py3-pip/fix-CVE-2024-47081.patch. The scanner detects requests 2.32.3 in vendor.txt, but the actual vulnerability (using ri.netloc instead of ri.hostname) has been fixed. The patched code uses ri.hostname for netrc lookups, preventing credential leakage.

          note: |
            The outdated version of urllib3 (1.26.20) is included because it's a dependency of py3-pip. Updating it will require the main pip project to release an update.
            However, the pip maintainers are holding off on that update until Python 3.9 reaches its end-of-life (EOL) at the end of 2025. Once that happens, pip can upgrade, and then kubeflow-katib will also need to update to align with the changes in pip.
